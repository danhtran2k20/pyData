    "For this project you will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. You will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Use the data to complete the following tasks:\r\n",
    "* Use Pandas to import the data from \"fcc-forum-pageviews.csv\". Set the index to the \"date\" column.\r\n",
    "* Clean the data by filtering out days when the page views were in the top 2.5% of the dataset or bottom 2.5% of the dataset.\r\n",
    "* Create a `draw_line_plot` function that uses Matplotlib to draw a line chart similar to \"examples/Figure_1.png\". The title should be \"Daily freeCodeCamp Forum Page Views 5/2016-12/2019\". The label on the x axis should be \"Date\" and the label on the y axis should be \"Page Views\".\r\n",
    "* Create a `draw_bar_plot` function that draws a bar chart similar to \"examples/Figure_2.png\". It should show average daily page views for each month grouped by year. The legend should show month labels and have a title of \"Months\". On the chart, the label on the x axis should be \"Years\" and the label on the y axis should be \"Average Page Views\".\r\n",
    "* Create a `draw_box_plot` function that uses Searborn to draw two adjacent box plots similar to \"examples/Figure_3.png\". These box plots should show how the values are distributed within a given year or month and how it compares over time. The title of the first chart should be \"Year-wise Box Plot (Trend)\" and the title of the second chart should be \"Month-wise Box Plot (Seasonality)\". Make sure the month labels on bottom start at \"Jan\" and the x and x axis are labeled correctly.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For each chart, make sure to use a copy of the data frame."
